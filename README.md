# Sox2_manuscript

## Introduction
In this study we investigated the Sox2 genomic locus in mESCs to better understand the positional relationship between the mouse Sox2 gene and its distal enhancer. We created high-resolution functional maps of the locus by relocating different Sox2-reporters to >1,000 alternative positions.
