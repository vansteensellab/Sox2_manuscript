# Sox2_manuscript

Introduction
In this study we investigated the Sox2 genomic locus in mESCs to better understand the positional relationship between the mouse Sox2 gene and its distal enhancer. We created high-resolution functional maps of the locus by relocating different Sox2-reporters to >1,000 alternative positions.
