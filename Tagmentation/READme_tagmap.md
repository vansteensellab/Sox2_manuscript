To analyse Tagmentation data we used tagmapAnalyseR, a stand-alone package integrated into the snakemake transposon mapping pipeline tagmap_hopping.

Details about the tagmap_hopping pipeline and the tagmapAnalyseR package can be found here: https://github.com/krademaker/tagmap_hopping

All config files used for the data in the manuscript is in ./Pipeline_config_files
The annotation of the launch pad (insert sequence and surrouding sequence) and the fasta file of the Tn5 plasmid are in ./home_location.
